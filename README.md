The Burger allows the user to enter a new burger name and save it in a database.

Burger displays a list of available burgers and allows the user to 'devour' it.

Burger also displays a list of devoured burgers.

## Technology

The Burger is node.js application deployed on Heroku.

**Frontend**

`Bootstrap` used for styling.

`jQuery` - to handle user input, API requests, and rendering results.

**Backend**

Burger is written on `JavaScript` and runs on `node.js`.
It uses an `express` package to run a webserver and handle API requests.

`Handlebars` templating engine responsible for dynamic HTML generation.

## Limitations

The current version doesn't allow let the user to delete devoured burgers.

Adding this important feature in our roadmap.
